#+TITLE: Alternative Splicing
#+AUTHOR: Mehmet Tekman

This is a [[https://d3js.org/][D3]] SVG visualization of random alternative splice sites. The [[https://mtekman.gitlab.io/alternative-splicing/][live demo can be
found here]], and the code repository is hosted at Gitlab. Pull requests should be made [[https://www.gitlab.com/mtekman/alternative-splicing][there]].

** What is this?

For a given =Reference Key= and =Splice Key=, a random genome is generated, along with
exons, splice sites, the resulting transcriptome, and the resulting exon transcripts.

** Types of Splicing Supported

 The visualization supports the following types of splicing events:

 - *CS*: Constitutive Splicing
 - *ES*: Exon Skipping
 - *AA*: Alternative 3’ Acceptor Splice Site
 - *AD*: Alternative 5’ Donor Splice Site
 - *IR*: Intron Retention

** Exercise Mode

If a custom =Reference Key= and =Splice Key= is given, then the chosen splice site
junctions are hidden from the user, and can only be accessed via a unique =Answer Key=.

Users can then try to guess what type of splicing occurred to generate the transcripts,
and a teacher can check their answers using the =Answer Key=.

Once the =Answer Key= is given, the splice sites are shown.
